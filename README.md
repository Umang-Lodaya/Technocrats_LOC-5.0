## CREATING DIGITAL IDENTITY
### Problem Statement:
#### **It's not just the time it takes to make government documents, it's the emotional toll it takes on you.**

The offline verification and document submission processes for any government document in India can be time-consuming, complex, and involve significant paperwork. It is like a rollercoaster of emotions, from frustration to anxiety to relief and can feel like you're jumping through hoops just to be recognized as a valid citizen, as individuals usually have to visit government offices in person to submit their documents and then wait for a long time to receive verification and approval. For example, a passport renewal process typically involves the submission of hard copies of various documents, such as identification cards, address proofs, and certificates, which need to be verified by government officials and takes several weeks or even months, depending on the volume of applications and the efficiency of the government office.

Creating a digital identity provides security, convenience, privacy, personalization to the citizens and eases the process of offline verification. Develop a collaborative approach to classify different proofs, images and documents into multiple predefined categories using a ML model and create a digital identity of a citizen. Furthermore, develop a process to create a biometrics system. Some algorithms can also be used to automate and streamline this process, making it more efficient and accurate.

Here are some points which the software can contain:
- Data collection and management: It can be used to collect and manage large volumes of personal data from various sources, such as government databases and financial
institutions.
- Identity creation and verification: The algorithm can be used to create and verify the identity of an individual by comparing the personal information provided against
various authentication factors, such as biometric data, government-issued identification documents, and social media accounts.
- Fraud detection: The algorithm can be used to detect and prevent fraud in the process of creating a digital identity.
- Risk assessment: The algorithm can be used to assess the risk associated with an individual's digital identity, such as the likelihood of identity theft or fraudulent activity.

Note: It is at your discretion to find new ways to develop a digital identity or create a new biometric process.
